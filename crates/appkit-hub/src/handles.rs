//! The one place of the kit that calls the system directly (Windows).
//!
//! A program that Rust starts on Windows inherits every handle of this process that is marked
//! inheritable, whatever its own stdin, stdout and stderr are: the standard handles of a
//! process that was itself started with a pipe (`<program> start | ...`, a job of an editor)
//! are such handles. A hub started from there would hold the pipe of the caller open for as long
//! as it runs, and the caller would wait for the end of its output until the hub stops. The
//! stable standard library has no way to say "inherit nothing" (`inherit_handles` is unstable),
//! so the standard handles of this process are made not inheritable before the hub is started.
//! The handles stay open and usable here; only a program started later does not get them
//! (one that is given them as its stdio, `Stdio::inherit`, still does: the standard library
//! duplicates them for it).
//!
//! A handle is handed on down the whole chain: a child gets every inheritable handle of its
//! parent, also those that are not its stdio, and it cannot name those to keep them. So every
//! process on the way to the hub does this before it starts the next one (`start`, and
//! `install`, which runs `<program> start`).
//!
//! The script host (`wscript.exe`) did this before; an endpoint protection stops a program that
//! starts the script host (appkit/start-ueber-wscript-von-edr-beendet).
